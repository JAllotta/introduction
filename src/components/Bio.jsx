            I was born in Melbourne Australia as my father was stationed out there as part of the US Air Force. 
            My family then moved to San Diego, CA when I was about three months old and have been here ever since, so I unfortunately I do not have the accent.
            I have two older brothers one born in Germany and the other in California, and we're all 5 years apart. 
            The biggest part of my childhood revolved around sports, mainly soccer through my youth with some basketball, and then Track & Field in the latter.
            I found my passion for software development in college. I went into college not knowing what I wanted to be, but I liked computers and video games,
            and decided I wanted to learn how a computer worked. I got my degree in Computer Engineering from San Diego State University, and by the end of it I had got that answered solved...
            at a high level. The summer before my last semester I landed an internship with General Atomics ASI, and have been there ever since.
